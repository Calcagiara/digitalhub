# Digitalhub

This repository provides deployment guidelines and some example use cases for the Digitalhub platform.

The deployment and usage instructions for each use case can be found in the *docs* folder.

The platform deployment is managed via Docker Compose. Each documented use case requires a subset of components and has a corresponding YAML file in the *docker-compose* folder. The same folder also contains Docker Compose files for single components.
